# Trade Acceptance Error Fix

## Problem
Users were getting "missing revert data" errors with `CALL_EXCEPTION` when trying to accept trades. This typically occurs when:
1. Required NFTs are not approved for trading
2. The user doesn't own the required NFTs
3. Insufficient MONAD balance

## Root Cause
The original `acceptTrade` function didn't check or handle NFT approvals automatically. Users had to manually approve NFTs before accepting trades, which was error-prone and led to failed transactions.

## Solution
Enhanced the `acceptTrade` function with automatic approval handling:

### Key Changes

1. **Automatic Approval Detection**: The function now checks which NFTs need approval before executing the trade
2. **Auto-Approval Process**: Automatically approves any required NFTs (both ERC721 and ERC1155)
3. **Progress Feedback**: Provides real-time progress updates via callback function
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages for common failure scenarios

### Function Flow
```javascript
async function acceptTrade(tradeId, walletClient, progressCallback) {
  // 1. Check required NFT approvals
  const requiredApprovals = await getRequiredApprovalsForTrade(tradeId, walletClient);
  
  // 2. Auto-approve each required NFT
  for (const approval of requiredApprovals) {
    if (approval.standard === 'ERC721') {
      await approveERC721ForTrading(approval.contractAddress, approval.tokenId, walletClient);
    } else {
      await approveERC1155ForTrading(approval.contractAddress, walletClient);
    }
  }
  
  // 3. Execute the trade
  const tx = await contract.acceptTrade(tradeId, { value: totalRequired });
  return tx.hash;
}
```

### User Experience
- **Before**: Click "Accept Trade" ‚Üí Error ‚Üí Manually approve NFTs ‚Üí Try again
- **After**: Click "Accept Trade" ‚Üí Automatic approvals ‚Üí Trade succeeds

### Frontend Integration
The frontend now shows progress messages during the acceptance process:
- "üîç Checking required NFT approvals..."
- "üîì Approving ERC721 NFT (1/2)..."
- "‚úÖ Approved ERC721 NFT (1/2)"
- "üíé Executing trade transaction..."
- "‚úÖ Trade accepted successfully!"

## Files Modified
1. `services/blockchain.ts` - Enhanced acceptTrade function
2. `app/trade/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated frontend to use new function
3. `scripts/test-enhanced-accept.js` - Test script for verification

## Result
Users can now accept trades with a single click, and the system automatically handles all required NFT approvals behind the scenes. This eliminates the "missing revert data" error and provides a seamless trading experience.
