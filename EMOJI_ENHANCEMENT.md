## Implementation Details

### Consistency Rules
1. **Always include 🔍** in loading messages to show "processing"
2. **Add context emoji** to clarify the specific action (✨ for creation, 💎 for execution, etc.)
3. **Maintain order**: 🔍 first, then context emoji, then descriptive text
4. **Space properly**: Single space between emojis and text

### Examples of the Pattern
```
🔍 ✨ Creating...        (magnifying glass + creation)
🔍 💎 Executing...       (magnifying glass + valuable transaction)
🔍 ⚡ Preparing...       (magnifying glass + fast processing)
🔍 📦 Sending...         (magnifying glass + transfer)
🔍 🔗 Creating link...   (magnifying glass + connection)
```

## Files Modified

## Result

The magnifying glass (🔍) creates visual consistency, while context-specific emojis (✨💎⚡📦🔗) help users understand the specific actions being performed.
